First, I imported the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization. Utilizing the Seaborn library, I loaded the Titanic dataset and began by inspecting its basic information. 
Commands such as shape, head, and info were used to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
To address missing values, I dropped the 'deck' column due to its significant number of missing entries. 
For the 'age' and 'embark_town' columns, I applied mean imputation and mode imputation, respectively, to fill in the missing data.
Next, I visualized the data through various plots. 
Count plots were created to display the number of survivors and to examine the influence of sex and passenger class on survival rates. 
To enhance clarity, I added labels to the bars in these plots. 
Additionally, I generated a histogram to illustrate the age distribution of passengers and a count plot to show the number of siblings/spouses aboard.
